Hangman code
Below is a list of words. The program randomly selects one word from this list, and the user must guess the word.
words = [“WHDSPQZ”, “XHO”, “TTDBFRT”, “QQJYF”, “ENQD”, “DNPK”, “CNTR”, “EHWHOD”, “TSVMOHOF”, “XNOCFQGTM”]
The words are encoded messages and are only decoded if the user is able to guess the word correctly. The user wins the game when the word is guessed correctly. The user is allowed to make 10 incorrect guesses before they lose.
After making an incorrect guess, word is decoded and printed.
